    <h2>Interesting Facts about Giraffes:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet.</li>
        <li>They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.</li>
        <li>A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.</li>
        <li>Giraffes only need to drink once every few days. Most of their water comes from all the plants they eat.</li>
        <li>Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing up.</li>
